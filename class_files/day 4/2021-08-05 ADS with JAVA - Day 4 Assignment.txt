Assignment:
1. Modify Delete() algorithm for singly linked list to work with tail pointer, along with head pointer.
   Implement a Delete() function for singly linked list class using the above algorithm.
Recommended: Practice TDD while doing the implementation and can add more test cases to SinglyLinkedListTest.

2. Implement AddAtRear() function in doubly linked list class DoublyLinkedList.
Recommended: Practice TDD while doing the implementation and can add more test cases to DoublyLinkedListTest.

3. Implement GetAllElementsInReverseOrder() function in doubly linked list class DoublyLinkedList.
   The function performs reverse traversal and return the elements stored in the doubly linkedlist, in reverse order.
Recommended: Practice TDD while doing the implementation and can add more test cases to DoublyLinkedListTest.
