Assignment:
1. Implement Insert() function for doubly linked list in a class by implementing SortedLinkedListIntf interface.
Recommended: Practice TDD while doing the implementation.

2. Implement all methods of SortedLinkedListIntf interface (refer to today's class file as the interface defination is updated) for circular doubly linked list that uses a dummy node.
Recommended: Practice TDD while doing the implementation.

3. Implement Stack ADT (Refer to the StackIntf interface defined on Day 1) using linked list.
Recommended: Practice TDD while doing the implementation.
