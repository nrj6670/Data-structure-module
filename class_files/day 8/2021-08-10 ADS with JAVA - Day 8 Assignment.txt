Assignment:
1. Implement the following interface (defined in BinarySearchTreeIntf.java) for binary search tree, in BinarySearchTree.java
public interface BinarySearchTreeIntf {
	public void Insert(int element);
	public void Delete(int element);
	public boolean Search(int element);

	public int[] InOrder();
}

Recommended: Practice TDD while doing the implementation. Some tests are implemented in BinarySearchTreeTest.java
