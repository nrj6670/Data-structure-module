Assignment:
1. Implement following three HashTable classes that implement Add, Search, Delete functions of HashTableIntf interface.
a) Modify the hash table implementation done in class to implement linear probing for collision handling.
b) Implement folding hash function and compare it with mod n hash function.
c) Implement mid square hash function and compare it with mod n hash function.
Recommended: Practice TDD while doing the implementation.
